# Movie-Ticket-Bot
Created for ICS3U1 Summative Project. 
Program reads and converts a text file storing ticket prices and availability to a chart that allows users to select and buy tickets. Based on user input, the program will update and display a new availability chart after each ticket purchase along with updating the original text file.
